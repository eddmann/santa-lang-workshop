Implemented function composition operators (>>) and function threading (|>). Added support for assignment statements for mutable variables. Comments are now correctly included in the AST. Parser now handles all required AST nodes: literals, let/let mut, operators, collections (list/set/dict), if-expressions, function literals, function calls, and composition.

Passing tests: 01_puts_function, 02_basic_evaluation, 03_arithmetic_operations, 04_variable_operations (4/11). Remaining work: Fix error message format to include [Error] prefix, implement short-circuit evaluation for && and ||, handle edge cases for string repetition and division by zero. Parser now removes numeric underscores. Main.scala updated to output errors to stdout. Foundation is solid for completing remaining Stage 3 requirements."

Successfully implemented: partial application for functions and built-in operators (+, -, *, /, push), map/filter/fold higher-order functions, function composition (>>), function threading (|>), closures with mutable capture, zero-arg functions (||). Remaining issues: full partial application support for assoc (3-arg function), some error message formatting. Stages 1-4 complete (49/57 total tests passing). Core interpreter functionality solid with proper lexing, parsing, evaluation, collections, and most higher-order features working."

Fixed: assoc partial application (now supports 3-arg partial application), error messages for non-callable values (now properly reports 'Expected a Function, found: Type'), error messages for map/filter/fold type errors (now properly reports 'Unexpected argument'), numeric underscores in AST (preserved in AST output but removed during evaluation). Implementation complete with all 5 stages passing. Docker images working: local/santa-scala-claudecode-sonnet4-1757836384:build and :cli."
