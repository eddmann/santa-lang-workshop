The issue was in UserFunction.call method - mutable variable changes were being captured before environment restoration but then immediately overwritten. Fixed by capturing changes first, restoring old environment, then writing back captured mutable variable changes to original scope AFTER restoration. This ensures proper closure semantics where: 1) Local mutable variables in nested scopes are captured by value and modifications stay within closure, 2) Global mutable variables are shared across closures and modifications are propagated back to global scope. The elf-lang Java implementation is now fully functional with all required features: lexing, parsing, evaluation, collections, functions, closures, partial application, higher-order functions, and error handling."
